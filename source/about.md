I'm a pretty late entrant into the web game, having started as a web developer in 2012. But I've been in touch with the web and technology for most of my life, while working as a graphics designer in private business and technology trainer and VLE admin at educational institutions. 

Here's a list of random facts:

- I jump on the back of horses and ride them. 
- I read. A lot.
- I build electronic things.
- I build bicycles.
- Then I ride them around a lot.
- I brew beer and mead. 
- Then I drink them.
- I'm a big gayer. 
- My accent confuses people. I've been accused of being Scottish, Irish, American and Swedish.
- I have voluntary control of my [tensor tympani muscles](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle)
- I [take photographs](https://flickr.com/photos/sonniesedge).
- "Well, you do have more than a touch of the German techno-anarchist about you".
- Yes, I'm a dirty leftie.
