I'm a pretty late entrant into the web game, having started as a web developer in 2012. But I've been in touch with the web and technology for most of my life, while working as a graphics designer in private business and technology trainer and VLE admin at educational institutions. 

Here's a list of random facts:

- I'm a keen horserider
- I read. A lot.
- I build electionic things.
- I build bicycles.
- Then I ride them around a lot.
- I brew beer and mead. 
- I'm a big gay.
- My accent confuses many people. 
- I have voluntary control of my [tensor tympani muscles](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle)
- I'm a photographer
- I'm a bit of a leftie. Well, more of an techno-anarchist/anarcho-communist. But practically I'm bourgasie scum.
